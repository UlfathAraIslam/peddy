# Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform 🐶🐱🐰

## Project Description
Peddy is a pet adoption platform that allows users to browse, filter, and adopt pets seamlessly. This project dynamically fetches pet data from the Peddy API and provides an interactive user experience with features like sorting, liking, and adopting pets.

## Key Features 🚀

### Navbar
- Fully responsive navigation bar based on Figma design.
- Collapses into a mobile-friendly menu on smaller screens.

### Dynamic Pet Listing & Filtering
- Displays all available pets by default.
- Users can filter pets by category (e.g., dogs, cats, birds).
- Includes a "Sort By Price" button to sort pets in descending order.

### Interactive UI Components
- "Like" button adds pet images to a favorite section.
- "Adopt" button initiates a countdown before marking the pet as adopted.
- Clicking "Details" opens a modal with full pet information.

### Loading Spinner & Error Handling
- A loading spinner appears while fetching data from the API.
- Gracefully handles missing API data by displaying placeholders or meaningful messages.

### Fully Responsive Design
- Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.
- Consistent UI elements matching the Figma design.

## ES6 Features Used ✨
- **Arrow Functions** (`() => {}`) for cleaner function syntax.
- **Template Literals** (`${variable}`) for dynamic string interpolation.
- **fetch() with async/await** for handling API calls.
